            This page is dedicated to reflecting on my learning journey while building this personal project.
            It helped me connect the dots across different parts of the full stack and gave me hands-on experience
            turning ideas into a working product.

              At first, I wasn’t sure where to begin. There were so many options, tools, and tutorials—it felt overwhelming.
              My main goal was to build something I would genuinely enjoy working on. I didn’t want to burn out or lose interest.
              This project became a way for me to practice consistently, stay motivated, and eventually have something to show
              for my hard work and growth.

            <p>
              I kickstarted this journey by completing the FreeCodeCamp course on basic HTML. Once I finished, I felt proud but not quite satisfied
              with how the project looked or felt. That motivated me to make improvements—first with CSS, then JavaScript.
              I learned how to fetch data from an external API, push my work to GitHub, and deploy a static version on GitHub Pages.
              Later, I moved to Render to support backend functionality. Each small step led to learning something new.

            <p>
              I used basic HTML and CSS for structure and design. As I got more confident, I started experimenting with layout styling,
              responsive design, and smoother interactions using JavaScript. I also explored UI improvements like hover effects, animations,
              and active state highlighting to make the app feel more polished. These small touches made a big difference in user experience.

              One of the most rewarding parts was integrating the Cat Photos API and seeing real images appear on the page—it brought the app to life.

          <div>
            <p>
              I created a simple backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. My goal was to store and retrieve cat facts.
              I learned how to set up routes, create a model, seed the database, and connect everything together.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the challenges I faced was connecting the frontend form to the backend—understanding how data flows from the browser,
              through the backend, and into the database helped me grasp full stack development better.
