            This page is dedicated to reflecting on my learning journey while building this personal project.
            It helped me connect the dots across different parts of the full stack and gave me hands-on experience
            turning ideas into a working product.

              At first, I wasn’t sure where to begin. There were so many options, tools, and tutorials—it felt overwhelming.
              My main goal was to build something I would genuinely enjoy working on. I didn’t want to burn out or lose interest.
              This project became a way for me to practice consistently, stay motivated, and eventually have something to show
              for my hard work and growth.

          <div>
            <p>
              I kickstarted this journey by completing the FreeCodeCamp course on basic HTML. Once I finished, I felt proud but not quite satisfied
              with how the project looked or felt. That motivated me to make improvements—first with CSS, then JavaScript.
              I learned how to fetch data from an external API, push my work to GitHub, and deploy a static version on GitHub Pages.
              Later, I moved to Render to support backend functionality. Each small step led to learning something new.

          <div>
            <p>
              The frontend started as a basic HTML structure. I improved the styling using custom CSS and made sure it was mobile-friendly
              by using Flexbox and media queries. I learned how to structure the app in reusable sections like navbar, content pages, and form inputs.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the highlights was using JavaScript to fetch cat images from an external API and dynamically display them in a responsive gallery.
              This was my first time using <code>fetch()</code> and handling JSON data in a personal project. I also added loading states and error handling
              to make the user experience smoother.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted the site to feel playful and polished, so I spent time improving UI with pastel color palettes, hover animations, active link styles,
              and a soft, rounded aesthetic.

          <summary class="developers-reflection-title">Backend</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              For the backend, I used Node.js and Express to build a basic API for serving static and dynamic cat facts.
              I connected the backend to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. I created a model to store facts, and seeded
              the database with a few fun cat facts to get started.
            </p>
            <p>
              I built GET routes to retrieve facts and started working on a POST route so users could submit their own.
              This helped me understand routing, HTTP methods, how to use middleware like <code>express.json()</code>,
              and how to handle request/response logic.
            </p>
            <p>
              I deployed the backend to Render and linked it with the frontend. Setting up CORS correctly between frontend and backend
              was a key step to get them to communicate properly.

                <strong class="developers-reflection-fix">Fix:</strong> I studied basic full stack project examples and followed the pattern of having separate folders
                for frontend and backend. This helped with organization and deployment.

                <strong class="developers-reflection-fix">Fix:</strong> I realised I was not using <code>preventDefault()</code> in my form handler,
                and also forgot to add <code>express.json()</code> in the backend to parse JSON body payloads. Once I fixed those,
                the POST request worked.

                <strong class="developers-reflection-problem">Problem:</strong> I was manually deploying changes each time which was tiring.<br>
                <strong class="developers-reflection-fix">Fix:</strong> I set up automatic deployment from GitHub to Render. This helped speed up my development flow and reduce errors.
