              From their secret communication skills to their gravity-defying jumps, cats are full of surprises.

              <li>
                <span class="cat-facts-title">Whisker Wonders:</span>
                <br>Cats use their whiskers not just for measuring gaps or spaces, but also to sense changes in their environment. Their whiskers can even detect vibrations in the air, like how a bat uses echolocation!
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="cat-facts-title">Cat's Purr Power:</span>
                <br>A cat’s purr isn’t just adorable – it’s therapeutic! Studies have shown that the frequency of a cat's purring can actually help to heal bones, reduce stress, and even lower blood pressure. Cats might be secret little therapists!
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="cat-facts-title">A Cat's "Meow":</span>
                <br>Adult cats only meow to communicate with humans – they don't typically meow to other cats. They’ve basically created their own language just for us!
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="cat-facts-title">Feline Speedsters:</span>
                <br>Cats can reach speeds of up to 30 miles per hour when sprinting. That’s faster than most humans can run, and it’s all thanks to their powerful back legs!
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="cat-facts-title">The Nose Knows:</span>
                <br>Cats have a much better sense of smell than humans – about 14 times better! They use their sense of smell to mark their territory, detect food, and even recognize their human friends.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="cat-facts-title">Sleepy Time:</span>
                <br>Cats spend about 70% of their lives sleeping! They’re not just lazy – cats are natural predators, and their sleep patterns help them conserve energy for hunting.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="cat-facts-title">Nine Lives, Sort of:</span>
                <br>Cats don’t actually have nine lives, but they are surprisingly resilient and can survive falls from great heights (as long as they don’t get injured by obstacles on the way down). It’s known as the "righting reflex."
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="cat-facts-title">Feline Good Luck Charm:</span>
                <br>In some cultures, a black cat crossing your path is considered a sign of good luck. In others, they’re believed to bring protection and prosperity!
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="cat-facts-title">The "Kneading" Habit:</span>
                <br>When cats knead you with their paws, it’s a leftover instinct from kittenhood. They used to knead their mom’s belly to stimulate milk production. It’s also a sign that they feel safe and comfortable!
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="cat-facts-title">Cat Communication 101:</span>
                <br>Cats have 32 muscles in their ears, allowing them to rotate them 180 degrees. So, no matter where you are, they’ll always hear you... just don’t expect them to come when you call!
              </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Who knew cats were such <em>fascinating</em> creatures, right? 😸</p>
