            <p>Hi! My name is dr3amcoder, and I love building cute and creative things on the web!</p>
            <p>This is my very first full-stack personal project, and it's been such a fun and rewarding experience.</p>
            <p>Thank you for stopping by — I hope this little CatPhotoApp brought you as much joy as it brought me while creating it!</p>
            <p>I'm currently learning full-stack development, and this project helped me explore how to connect the front end
            <br> and back end, work with APIs, and design a playful user experience.</p>
            <p>This app was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned—there’s more to come!</p>
