Welcome to CatPhotoApp! This is my very first personal project, built as part of my journey to learn web development. I followed the awesome tutorial from FreeCodeCamp and then added a few of my own improvements. It’s a simple but fun app that showcases cute cat photos, and I’ve since expanded its functionality to include a backend with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for dynamic data storage!


# 💫 About
