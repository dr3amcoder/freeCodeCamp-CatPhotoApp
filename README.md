# 🐈‍⬛🐈 CatPhotoApp
Welcome to CatPhotoApp! This is my very first personal project, built as part of my journey to learn web development. I followed the awesome tutorial from FreeCodeCamp and then added a few of my own improvements. It’s a simple but fun app that showcases cute cat photos, and I’ve since expanded its functionality to include a backend with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for dynamic data storage!<br >


# 💫 About
CatPhotoApp is a beginner-friendly project where I learned the basics of web development. The app shows a collection of adorable cat photos, perfect for bringing a smile to your face! 🐾 <br >
<strong>P.S.</strong> The project began by following the tutorial on FreeCodeCamp to learn the basic of HTML & CSS, I then made some updates after the initial version to add a little extra fun.<br >
